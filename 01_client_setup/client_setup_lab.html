<h1 class="title">Cloud Architecture Client Setup Lab</h1>
</header>
<p>The aim of this lab is to set up your client environment in the lab.
I recommend that you use the same computer each session as some
configuration files and key pairs need to be placed in the appropriate
folders. However I have also provided scripts to copy these to/from
OneDrive assuming that you’ve set it up.</p>
<h1 id="task-1-git-repository">Task 1: Git repository</h1>
<p>Ensure that you have a copy of the Git repository for the module in a
location <em>not managed by OneDrive</em>. Make sure that it is up to
date by running:</p>
<pre><code>git pull --rebase</code></pre>
<h1 id="task-2-enable-script-execution">Task 2: Enable script
execution</h1>
<p>Open Windows Terminal. Make sure that it’s a PowerShell (not cmd)
terminal by ensuring the <code>PS</code> prompt is visible on the left.
Navigate to this <code>01_client_setup</code> folder. (Hint: you can
copy the path in Windows 11 by right-clicking the
<code>01_client_setup</code> folder and <code>cd</code> into it.</p>
<p>We will use PowerShell (and other) scripts a lot in this module.
PowerShell scripts are restricted by default in Windows. To check if
your user account on this PC permits PowerShell script execution try
running the test script provided by typing:</p>
<pre><code>./test_script.ps1</code></pre>
<p>You should see a message printed in Green. If not then run:</p>
<pre><code>Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser</code></pre>
<p>Close and re-open PowerShell. Navigate back to this
<code>01_client_setup</code> folder. Make sure that the test script
<code>./test_script.ps1</code> now runs. Don’t move on to the next task
until this works.</p>
<h1 id="task-2-client-software-check">Task 2: Client software check</h1>
<p>We will now run a script to check that your client PC has all the
needed software. The specialist lab PCs should pass these checks - if
they don’t you need to let me know and we will raise a ticket.
Nevertheless, we’ll confirm anyway as sometimes software can be missing
or not accessible.</p>
<p>Run the script:</p>
<pre><code>./client_check.ps1</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that it prints a message in green that the PC has all
required packages installed for completing this module. If it does not,
stop and let me know.</p>
<h2 id="working-from-home-or-own-device">Working from home or own
device</h2>
<p>If you want to work at home you can use this (or
<code>client_check.sh</code> on Mac / Linux) to verify that your system
has all required packages. The script will give the links to download
required software.</p>
<p>In terms of expectations, I only can support use of lab PCs and
cannot troubleshoot your home or mobile configurations. In theory most
of the configuration here should work on home / mobile devices but I
can’t guarantee it.</p>
<h1 id="task-3-xoa-setup">Task 3: XOA setup</h1>
<p>We may use XOA at some stages in the module to demonstrate some
concepts at a lower cost than the commercial cloud platforms and explore
private cloud environments.</p>
<h2 id="check-that-xoa-works">Check that XOA works</h2>
<p>Make sure that you can log into XOA. If you see the
<code>New VM</code> button then move on ahead to the next task. If not,
request permissions as in next section.</p>
<h2 id="xoa-permission-request">XOA permission request</h2>
<p>To request permissions to XOA visit https://xoarequest.comp.dkit.ie/
. The technical staff will review requests and grant permissions.</p>
<h1 id="task-4-ssh-keys">Task 4: SSH keys</h1>
<p>You previously have encountered SSH keys for connecting to remote
machines, and in the case of AWS for decrypting Windows VM passwords.
Keys can be encrypted and therefore protected by a passphrase. We will
for now not use this, but you can do so if you like. Just don’t forget
your Passphrase!</p>
<p>In some exercises we’ll use alternative key pairs that we’ll generate
on-demand as needed.</p>
<h2 id="generate-ed25519-key-pair">Generate ED25519 key pair</h2>
<p>ED25519 key pairs are best for logging into Linux instances. Your
ED25519 key pair can be created by running the command:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519</code></pre>
<p>Just hit enter to accept all the defaults. You may have to enter
<em>Yes</em> to overwrite the existing key(s) if they exist. Your SSH
key pair will be stored in <em>two</em> files in the <code>.ssh</code>
subdirectory of your home folder:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id_ed25519</code> stores the private key</li>
<li><code>id_ed25519.pub</code> stores the public key</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="generate-2048-bit-rsa-key-pair">Generate 2048-bit RSA key
pair</h2>
<p>AWS uses SSH key pairs to securely provide the password for Windows
instances as standard. Unfortunately these use 2048-bit RSA keys. We’ll
generate one here using the command:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 </code></pre>
<p>As before, just hit enter to accept all the defaults. You may have to
enter <em>Yes</em> to overwrite the existing key(s) if they exist. Your
SSH key pair will be stored in <em>two</em> files in the
<code>.ssh</code> subdirectory of your home folder:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id_rsa</code> stores the private key</li>
<li><code>id_rsa.pub</code> stores the public key</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="task-5-microsoft-azure-acount-setup">Task 5: Microsoft Azure
acount setup</h1>
<p>We’ll also use Microsoft Azure in this module using the free credit
for students offer. <a
href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students">Sign up to Azure
by visiting this link</a> and logging in with your <em>DkIT</em>
credentials. You should use your full DkIT credentials to login.</p>
<h2 id="azure-console">Azure console</h2>
<p>After signing up, make sure you can see the Azure web console. Like
AWS we’ll use it to begin with.</p>
<h2 id="azure-cli">Azure CLI</h2>
<p>Setting up the Azure CLI is much easier than AWS. Just run the
command:</p>
<pre><code>az login</code></pre>
<p>Which will initiate first a graphical authentication flow, and will
then let you select the required <em>subscription</em>. Make sure to
choose the one that states <code>Azure for Students</code> and tenant
<code>Dundalk Institute of Technology</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[Tenant and subscription selection]

No     Subscription name    Subscription ID                       Tenant
-----  -------------------  ------------------------------------  -------------------------------
[1] *  Azure for Students   2ade98b8-837d-4d50-b5a0-fda27c7eb599  Dundalk Institute of Technology

The default is marked with an *; the default tenant is &#39;Dundalk Institute of Technology&#39; and subscription is &#39;Azure for Students&#39; (2ade98b8-837d-4d50-b5a0-fda27c7eb599).

Select a subscription and tenant (Type a number or Enter for no changes): 1</code></pre>
<p>If you have multiple subscriptions shown you’ll need to type the
correct number for the <code>Dundalk Institute of Technology</code>
subscription. It should then confirm:</p>
<pre><code>Tenant: Dundalk Institute of Technology
Subscription: Azure for Students (2ade98b8-837d-4d50-b5a0-fda27c7eb599)</code></pre>
<h2 id="confirm-az-cli-works">Confirm az cli works</h2>
<p>To confirm your Azure CLI works you can run the command:</p>
<pre><code>az account show</code></pre>
<p>It should print out your basic account information in JSON
format.</p>
<h1 id="task-6-aws-account-setup">Task 6: AWS account setup</h1>
<p>We will also use an AWS account in this module. You previously have
used an AWS account in Cloud Foundations and Cloud Technologies.</p>
<h2 id="log-into-aws-console-on-the-web">Log into AWS Console on the
web</h2>
<p>Make sure that you can log into your AWS account on the website.</p>
<h2 id="confirm-aws-account-works-on-the-console">Confirm AWS account
works on the console</h2>
<p>You can use any AWS command you like that requires authentication. I
often use:</p>
<pre><code>aws sts get-caller-identity</code></pre>
<p>which just prints your account information.</p>
